SyncMap: AI-Enhanced Microservices for Real-Time Mapping
SyncMap is a full-stack capstone project enabling real-time, collaborative data visualization. My primary contribution involved designing and integrating Python-based microservices that provide image processing and text-to-speech (TTS) functionality to the main Flutter application.

Key Technical Contributions:
• Image Processing API: Text extraction and denoising from map images using EasyOCR, OpenCV, and Inpainting.
• Text-to-Speech API: Converts extracted text into audio using gTTS and pyttsx3 for accessibility.
• Architecture: Implemented RESTful APIs with FastAPI, deployed via Uvicorn, enabling seamless communication with a Dart/Flutter front end.

Skills Demonstrated: AI-powered microservices, Python backend design, API integration, FastAPI, OCR, TTS, containerization, and cross-language system integration.
