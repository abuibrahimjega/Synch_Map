                              SyncMap Capstone:
AI-Enhanced Microservices for Real-Time MappingThe SyncMap project is a full-stack solution designed for real-time, collaborative data visualization. My primary contribution focused on the development and integration of the Python Backend Microservices to add advanced Image Processing and Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities to the core application.This work demonstrates expertise in FastAPI, Python ML libraries, and cross-language system integration (Python with Dart/Flutter).Technical Contribution Focus: Python MicroservicesMy role was to design, implement, and integrate two separate, containerized Python microservices that act as the intelligence layer for the main application:MicroserviceFunctionalityKey TechnologiesImage Processing APIText Removal (Denoising) and Text Extraction (OCR) from map images.EasyOCR, OpenCV, Inpainting, FastAPIText-to-Speech APIConverts extracted text into audio for accessibility and hands-free use.gTTS, pyttsx3, FastAPI
 System Integration & ArchitectureThe key technical challenge was enabling seamless communication between the main front-end application (built in Dart/Flutter) and these asynchronous Python microservices.Integration Method: The Dart/Flutter front-end communicates with the Python backend by calling the RESTful API endpoints exposed by the FastAPI microservices.Workflow Example: A user uploads a map image via the Flutter app. The app sends the image to the Image Processing API (e.g., /extract-text), which uses EasyOCR for text extraction. The extracted text is then passed from the main application to the Text-to-Speech API (e.g., /speak) to generate an audio response, enhancing accessibility.Demonstrated Skill: This architecture proves competence in building and integrating scalable, decoupled systems using Python as the core data processing language.API Documentation (Reference)The following APIs are deployed via Uvicorn and can be accessed independently:Image Processing API (uvicorn main_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000)EndpointMethodDescription/remove-textPOSTDetects and removes text from uploaded images using OCR and inpainting./extract-textPOSTExtracts raw text from an image for further processing.Documentation:http://localhost:5000/docsText-to-Speech API (uvicorn text_to_speech:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001)EndpointMethodDescription/speakPOSTConverts input text into an MP3 audio file using gTTS or pyttsx3./voicesGETRetrieves a list of available TTS voices/engines.Documentation:http://localhost:5001/docs
